# Becoming_cracked_cpp

This monorepo documents my trajectory from absolute zero to becoming cracked at C++.

I have no prior experience with this language. This repository serves as a rigid archive of my progression, housing every project from basic syntax exercises to complex systems as I advance. The ultimate objective is to write GOATED code and master manual memory management.

We maintain W motion only.

## Project Index

The repository is organised as a monorepo. As my proficiency increases, more complex directories will be initialised.

| Project Name | Description | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01_pointer_int_sort** | A programme that takes three integers and sorts them in ascending order using direct memory manipulation. | Pointers, dereferencing, conditional logic. |
| **02_rock_paper_scissors** | A standard console-based implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. | Input handling, randomisation, control flow. |

## Progression

I am currently in the foundational phase. Future additions will explore:

* Object-Oriented Programming principles.
* Data Structures and Algorithms.
* Advanced memory management and smart pointers.
* Multi-threading and concurrency.
